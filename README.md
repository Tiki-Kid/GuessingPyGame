# GuessingPyGame
This is my attempt at making a fun little interactive user-friendly game me and my friends can try.

The program generates a random number between 1 and 20 and gives the user 3 valid attemps
at guessing the right number. The user will get little hints along the way.

This program uses a while loop to iterate using a counter.
It also includes a series of if-else statements that guide the program down the right rabbit hole.
the if-else statements validate the users input so if its outside the bounds, it will let the user
know and give him/her another attempt without taking away one of his/her attempts.
Also as the user inputs his/her valid guesses the program will let the user know if its too high or too low.
